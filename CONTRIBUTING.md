## Acceptance Criteria

Unfortunately, not every resource can be included. The aim of the list is to provide a concise list of noteworthy modern software. A suggested resource must meet at least one of the following criteria:

**(a) Widely recommended** - Regardless of personal opinion, it is widely recommended by the community.

**(b) Highly discussed** - Due to its innovative nature, it generates active discussion in the community.

**(c) Unique in its approach** - It has an absolutely unique approach and function.

**(d) Niche product** - It fills a specific gap that is not covered by other tools.

**Important note:** Self-promotion is frowned upon and will be reviewed critically, but the suggestion will be approved if it meets the criteria.

## Pull Request Guide

3. **Review format**: Follow the [Entry Format](#entry-format)

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch** (optional, but recommended):

5. **Push to your fork**:

### Pull Request Rules
